    "(b) Scalability: MongoDB is highly scalable and can handle large amounts of data and traffic with ease.\n",
    "It supports sharding, which allows you to distribute data across multiple servers for improved performance and availability.\n",
    "(c) High availability: MongoDB provides automatic failover and replica sets to ensure that your data is always available,\n",
    "even in the event of hardware or network failures.\n",
    "(d) Flexible schema: MongoDB has a flexible schema, which means that you can easily modify your data model as your application evolves.\n",
    "(e) Rich query language: MongoDB provides a powerful and flexible query language that allows you to perform complex queries on your data.    "
